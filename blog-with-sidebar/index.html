          Ryuga Banjo, also known as Kamen Rider Ryuga, has a complex and 
          evolving motive in Kamen Rider Ryuki. Initially, Ryuga appears as an 
          antagonist to the protagonist, Shinji Kido (the main Kamen Rider Ryuki). 
          However, his motives become clearer as the series progresses.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, Ryuga is driven by a desire for vengeance and personal gain. 
          His main goal is to defeat the other Riders in the Mirror World and 
          become the last one standing, which would grant him the ability to make 
          a wish granted by the mysterious contract with the Dragon. Ryuga is 
          initially portrayed as ruthless, showing little regard for others in 
          pursuit of his goal. His actions often come across as cold and calculating.
        </p>
         <p>
          However, his motivations are rooted in deeper emotions. Ryugaâ€™s tragic 
          backstory involves being manipulated by Shiro Kanzaki, the creator of 
          the Rider battle and the one behind the Mirror World. Kanzaki offers 
          Ryuga a chance for revenge against those who have wronged him, 
          particularly targeting his former partner, Ren Akiyama (Kamen Rider 
          Knight), and other Riders.
