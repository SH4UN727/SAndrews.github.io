            Kamen Rider Zi-O (仮面ライダージオウ, Kamen Raidā Jiō) is a Japanese 
            tokusatsu drama in Toei Company's Kamen Rider Series. It is the 
            twentieth and final entry of the Heisei Era, serving to commemorate 
            its 20th Anniversary, and the thirty-third series overall. The 
            series premiered on September 2, 2018 and joined Kaitou Sentai
            Lupinranger VS Keisatsu Sentai PatrangerIcon-crosswiki in the Super 
            Hero Time line-up after the finale of Kamen Rider Build. After 
            Lupinranger VS Patranger’s conclusion, it was joined by 4 Week 
            Continuous Special Super Sentai Strongest Battle!!Icon-crosswiki in 
            February 2019 and later Kishiryu Sentai RyusoulgerIcon-crosswiki in 
            March 2019.

            The motif of the series is time. The series' tagline is "I will 
            become the king of Kamen Riders!" (俺は仮面ライダーの王となる！, Ore wa 
            Kamen Raidā no ō to naru!). Much like Kamen Rider Decade, it 
            commemorates all of the Heisei-era Kamen Riders to date.

          <h1>Production</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>
          The initial plan for the 2018 season was supposed to be Kamen Riders 
          piloting giant robots to fight each other. However, crews had stated 
          that it shares too much similarities with Super Sentai franchise. 
          Therefore, the brainstorm groups added a concept that those robots are 
          able to travel in time, and makes sense if the protagonist can meet 
          with previous Legend Rider, and put into production following this idea.
          <br>
          Producer Shirakura stated that like Decade, Zi-O was the culmination 
          of the entire Heisei-era, which would end when Prince Naruhito ascended 
          to the Japanese throne in 2019. Viewership ratings from Build were at 
          a new low, and Shirakura noticed that those ratings were 40% higher 
          during Decade. Shirakura was also extremely hesitant to bring back 
          former actors as well as deal with the tricky concepts of time travel 
          like Den-O, but his associate producers convinced him to tackle them 
          as Shirakura was willing to give it a try.
          <br>
          Both Gaim and Ghost had began the idea of having multiple Riders use 
          the same transformation belt, similar to how Super Sentai Rangers 
          transform using the same device but in a more controlled setting. 
          Shirakura had liked the idea, and allowed both Geiz and Tsukuyomi to 
          use a Ziku-Driver like Sougo to transform. During the original designing 
          stages for Zi-O's suit, Shirakura was interested in the motif of time 
          itself he felt it symbolized the Heisei-era, so "Rider" in katakana was
          added to Zi-O's mask for his default form. To differentiate Zi-O's 
          means of transportation and time travel, the Time Mazine was introduced 
          as opposed to a train and other supernatural means.
